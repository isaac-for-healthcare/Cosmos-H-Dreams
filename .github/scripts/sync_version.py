"""Sync the canonical version from flashdreams/_version.py to all pyproject.toml files.

The version in ``flashdreams/flashdreams/_version.py`` is the single source of
truth for the entire monorepo.  This script reads it and updates the
``version = "..."`` line in every workspace-member ``pyproject.toml``, except
for packages with independent versioning (ludus-renderer, self-forcing
parity-check).

Intended to run as a pre-commit hook and as a CI safety-net step.

Exit codes:
    0 -- all versions were already in sync (no files changed).
    1 -- one or more files were updated (pre-commit will re-stage them).
