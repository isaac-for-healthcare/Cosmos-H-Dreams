Launch your first model
===================================

This page provides a minimal path for:

1. Offline / batch-like long-rollout model inference with
   :doc:`Self-Forcing </models/self_forcing>`.
2. Online interactive world-model serving with
   :doc:`LingBot-World </models/lingbot_world>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Complete the setup in :doc:`/quickstart/installation` first.

Run Self-Forcing T2V offline inference
--------------------------------------

Launch an offline inference run using the :doc:`Self-Forcing </models/self_forcing>` model:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/self_forcing \
       flashdreams-run self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-taehv \
       --total-blocks 7

First runs take several minutes (Triton autotuning + CUDA-graph
warmup); subsequent runs finish in well under a minute. Output lands
at ``outputs/self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-taehv.mp4`` (16 FPS, 480×832
by default). See :doc:`/models/self_forcing` for ``--total-blocks``,
measured runtimes, and multi-GPU guidance.

Run LingBot-World interactive server
------------------------------------

Launch an interactive serving session using the :doc:`LingBot-World </models/lingbot_world>` model:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/lingbot \
       flashdreams-run lingbot-world-fast \
       --example-data True \
       --total-blocks 21
