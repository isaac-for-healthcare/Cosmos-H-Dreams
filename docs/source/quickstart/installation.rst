Installation
===================================

Choose the setup path that matches your goal.

Use FlashDreams as a library
----------------------------

Install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install flashdreams

Install the latest main branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git"

.. _run-models-directly-in-this-codebase:

Run models directly in this codebase
------------------------------------

We recommend to use the ``uv`` python package manager (installation instructions `here <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_).
With ``uv`` installed, clone the repository and use the workspace environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git
   cd flashdreams
   uv sync --extra dev --extra runners

The unified runner CLI is available through ``uv run``:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run flashdreams-run --help

.. _environment-variables:

Environment variables
---------------------

Most model runs need Hugging Face authentication:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
   export HF_HOME=~/.cache/huggingface  # optional

For more environment and container details, see the project
`README <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/README.md>`_ and
the model pages under :doc:`/models/index`.
