    First write clones into a fresh buffer; subsequent same-shape writes
    ``copy_`` in place. Pointer stability is required for CUDA-graph
    capture, since captured kernels reference the slot's storage address.

    ``state`` is intentionally typed as the loose ``dict`` because the
    three call sites use incompatible parametrisations (``dict[str,
    Tensor | None]`` for the FlashVSR projector cache, ``dict[int,
    Tensor]`` for the Wan VAE and TAEHV streaming caches) and

class CUDAGraphWrapper:
    """Capture a stateful CUDA callable into a replayable graph.

    The callable runs eagerly for ``warmup_iters`` calls so kernels JIT-load
    and the allocator stabilises. The next call captures the whole forward
    into a ``torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`` against static input buffers; every
    same-shape call after that copies inputs into those buffers and replays
    the graph, returning clones of the captured outputs.

    Captured kernels reference the static input pointers, the callable's
    parameters, the output buffer pointers, and any in-place-mutated buffers
    (e.g. cache slots). Those internal buffers must have stable storage
    addresses — typically by writing through ``copy_`` once a slot's shape
    stabilises.

    Input staging: only top-level tensor positional args and kwargs are
    copied into static buffers. Everything else (ints, ``None``, dicts,
    custom objects) passes through verbatim. This is intentional: callers
    routinely pass mutable state through containers (e.g. a streaming cache
    as a ``dict[int, Tensor]``) and recursing in would break the in-place
    semantics. Pass any per-call-varying tensor as its own arg.

    A change in the staged-tensor signature drops the graph and restarts
    warmup. ``reset`` does the same explicitly — call it when external
    state (e.g. a fresh streaming cache) is swapped out.

    Compatibility with ``torch.compile``: a compiled ``fn`` is fine, but
    Inductor + triton trigger lazy autotunes (illegal during capture) on the
    first call per shape. Drain them on the eager path via ``drain``
    (or an unwrapped call) before the wrapped path captures, otherwise
    capture fails with ``cudaErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported``.

    Examples:

        wrapper = CUDAGraphWrapper(model.forward, warmup_iters=2)

        # Rollout 1: drain Inductor autotune on the eager path.
        for chunk in first_rollout_chunks:
            y = wrapper.drain(chunk, timesteps=t, cache=cache)

        # Rollout 2+: capture + replay.
