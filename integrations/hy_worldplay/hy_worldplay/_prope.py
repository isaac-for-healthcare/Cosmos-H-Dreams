r"""PRoPE-style projective positional encoding for multi-view attention.

Ports the bit pattern of ``hyvideo/prope/camera_rope.py::prope_qkv`` from
`PRoPE: Projective Positional Encoding for Multiview Transformers
<https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HY-WorldPlay/blob/main/hyvideo/prope/camera_rope.py>`_
(MIT-licensed) so the native HY-WorldPlay path can apply per-camera
projective transforms to Q/K/V before attention without importing the
upstream HY-WorldPlay tree at runtime.

The transform is a block-diagonal matrix multiply on the per-head feature
axis: each camera's tokens get multiplied by a 4×4 matrix derived from
that camera's world-to-camera extrinsic and (optional) intrinsic. The
matrices are

* ``P = lift(K) @ viewmats``    (image ← world; passed through query)
* ``P_inv = inv(viewmats) @ lift(inv(K))``  (world ← image; passed through K, V)
* ``P_T = P.transpose(-1, -2)`` (applied to query)

so the attention score :math:`Q P_q \cdot K^T P_{k}^{-T}` evaluates to the
upstream pair-wise projective positional encoding. The post-attention
output is multiplied by ``P`` of the query's camera to undo the input
basis change.

Numeric semantics mirror upstream exactly: same einsum order, same
single-precision cast points, same block-diagonal partitioning on the
``head_dim`` axis (which must be divisible by 4 because the projection
matrices are 4×4). Tests under
``integrations/hy_worldplay/tests/test_prope.py`` cross-check this port
against a numpy reference.
