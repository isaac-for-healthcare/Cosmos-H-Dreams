# `omnidreams`

Omnidreams integration package for `flashdreams`.

## Hugging Face assets

Omnidreams resolves public Omni Dreams assets from the `nvidia` Hugging Face
org:

- `nvidia/omni-dreams-models` for checkpoints.
- `nvidia/omni-dreams-samples` for bundled example data.
- `nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes` for WebRTC scenes.

Set `HF_TOKEN` to a token with access to these repos before running or
importing FlashDreams:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HF-TOKEN>
```

## Run interactive-drive (desktop demo)

The `omnidreams.interactive_drive` subpackage ships a single-process
driving demo with a Ludus OpenGL raster backend and a PyTorch world-model
backend ([see its README](omnidreams/interactive_drive/README.md) for the
full guide). From the flashdreams workspace root:

```bash
uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra interactive-drive
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams interactive-drive
```

The `interactive-drive` extra adds `slangpy` (the Vulkan-backed local
windowing runtime); server users running only `omnidreams.webrtc` or
`omnidreams.grpc` can skip it. The default scene auto-stages from
`nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes` on first launch when `HF_TOKEN` is set; use
`omnidreams-prepare` for explicit staging of arbitrary scene UUIDs
or to pre-warm the ~14 GB Cosmos-Reason1 text encoder.

## Native DiT defaults

NVIDIA OmniDreams native DiT acceleration remains gated by the pipeline config's
`native_dit_acceleration` policy (`disabled`, `auto`, or `required`). When that
native path is enabled, the default compute profile is the FP8 KV-cache backend
with cuDNN attention:

- `native_dit_backend="fp8_kvcache_cudnn"`
- `native_dit_attention_backend="auto"` (currently resolves to cuDNN)

Set `native_dit_attention_backend="sparge"`, `"sage3"`, or `"sage3_fp8"`
explicitly to opt into Sparge/SageAttention-3 experiments. Use
`native_dit_sparge_hybrid_period > 1` with `"sparge"` to enable the FP8
Sparge/SageAttention-3 hybrid schedule when the extension and GPU support it.

## Run WebRTC server

From the workspace root, run:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 -m omnidreams.webrtc.server --pipeline_config_name omnidreams-sv-2steps-chunk2-loc6-lightvae-lighttae-perf --scene-uuid 0d404ff7-2b66-498c-b047-1ed8cded60d4 --port 8089
```

When `--scene_dir` is omitted, the server downloads the selected scene from the
configured Hugging Face org, extracts its `clipgt-<uuid>[-<variant>].usdz`
archive, and stages it under `FLASHDREAMS_CACHE_DIR` (or `~/.cache/flashdreams`).
If `--scene-uuid` is omitted too, the server uses the default WebRTC scene.
Weather variants ship as sibling archives; pass `--scene-variant rain` (or
`snow`) to serve one (default is the clear-weather scene). The runtime seeds
from the scene's first ground-truth camera frame
(`clipgt/frames/<camera>/<ts>.jpeg`, falling back to `clipgt/first_image.*`) and
the weather-matched `clipgt/prompt<N>.txt` (falling back to `clipgt/prompt.txt`).
Pass `--scene_dir <path>` to use a pre-staged local scene instead.

## Run gRPC server

From the workspace root, run:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 -m omnidreams.grpc.server --pipeline_config_name omnidreams-sv-2steps-chunk2-loc6-lightvae-lighttae-perf --host 0.0.0.0 --port 50051
```

The server implements `omnidreams.grpc.protos.video_model.WorldModelService`
and listens on `0.0.0.0:50051` by default. Clients provide the static map,
camera specs, initial frames, prompt, rig trajectory, and dynamic actor state
through the gRPC API. Use `--record_dir <dir>` to save replayable session logs,
and add `--enable_profiling --profile_output <path>` when collecting timing
data. For distributed/context-parallel launches, increase `--nproc_per_node`;
the world size must be compatible with the selected pipeline config's camera
count.
