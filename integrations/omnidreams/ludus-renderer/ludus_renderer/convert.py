Conversion utilities for ludus_renderer.

Note: Direct scene loading via clipgt.py is preferred. The clipgt module 
handles conversion internally and provides ready-to-use TimestampedScene objects.

For custom scene building, see the primitives in ludus_renderer._ops:
- TimestampedPolylinePool
- TimestampedPolygonPool  
- ObstaclePool
- TimestampedScene
