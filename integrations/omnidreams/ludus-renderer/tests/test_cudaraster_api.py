Contract suite for `FW::CudaRaster` (the C++ class under
`ludus_renderer/_cpp/cudaraster/`).

Purpose
-------
The `cudaraster/` directory now contains the original BSD-3-Clause
CudaRaster code from the HPG 2011 paper "High-Performance Software
Rasterization on GPUs" by Laine and Karras. This suite pins the API
contract that the ported implementation must satisfy. The upstream code
requires adaptation: Volta+ warp divergence fixes, API shims to match
the `CR::CudaRaster` interface that ludus_cuda.cu expects, and removal
of the FW framework dependencies.

Marker conventions used in this file
------------------------------------
1. Plain test  -- positive contract a correct impl must satisfy.
2. CURRENT-IMPL REGRESSION MARKER  -- pins a known-quirky behavior of the
   current impl (e.g. tile-boundary pixel drop, multi-image image-1 left
   uninitialized). When a cleanroom change makes one of these fail, the
   header on the test tells you whether to delete the marker or investigate.
3. POSITIVE CONTRACT + xfail(strict=True)  -- the behavior we want, asserted
   today against a broken impl. xfail keeps the suite green; xpass is loud
   when the cleanroom fixes the bug.
4. CURRENT-IMPL FAILURE-MODE MARKER  -- pins the *exact stderr signature* of
   a current crash (CUDA-700 in depth peeling and the overflow path). When
   the failure mode changes for any reason, this test fails loudly so we
   know to look.

What the main app actually uses from `CR::CudaRaster`
-----------------------------------------------------
Audited in `ludus_renderer/_cpp/render/ludus_cuda.cu` (lines 2079-2204,
2309-2398). The vehicle/HD-map render path is the only consumer.

  setBufferSize(W, H, 1)           # always numImages = 1
  setVertexBuffer(float4 GPU ptr)
  setIndexBuffer(int32 GPU ptr)
  setTiebreakerColorBuffer(...)    # always set, every frame
  setDeterministicTiebreaker(true) # always true
  deferredClear(0)                 # always clear-to-zero
  setViewport(...)                 # MULTIPLE per frame (nested tiles)
  drawTriangles(nullptr, false, stream)  # no ranges, no peel, NON-DEFAULT stream
  getColorBuffer()                 # every frame; depth never read

Never called by the main app:
  setRenderModeFlags         (so flags=0: no backface cull, no peeling)
  swapDepthAndPeel           (no peeling)
  getDepthBuffer             (depth not consumed)
  ranges parameter           (always nullptr)
  numImages > 1
  non-deterministic tiebreaker
  non-zero clear color

Out of scope for the cudaraster cleanroom (handled elsewhere)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Differentiability -- not used anywhere; every requires_grad in the
  workspace is False, the render output is detach()ed and uint8-cast in
  `interactive_drive/rasterizer.py:211` before reaching any model.
* Barycentrics -- CudaRaster does NOT output them. `ludus_cuda.cu`
  `fragmentKernel` (line 1850+) reconstructs them from triangle id +
  vertex positions + pixel-center NDC. Cleanroom only has to keep
  triangle id + bottom-up Y correct -- both pinned by existing tests.
* MSAA -- implemented as 2x SSAA + downsample in `ludus_cuda.cu`, not in
  cudaraster. setMsaaSamples lives on LudusCudaStateWrapper.
* Texture sampling, antialias pass -- not in cudaraster.

Companion validation suite
--------------------------
This file is not the only thing that exercises cudaraster. The other leg is:

  samples/interactive-drive/tests/test_raster_reference_image.py
    ::test_raster_reference_image

It drives the full pipeline:
  LudusConditionRasterizer -> LudusCudaTimestampedContext
    -> ludus_render_fwd_cuda_timestamped (torch_rasterize_cuda.cpp)
    -> ludusCudaRenderTimestamped (ludus_cuda.cu)
    -> CR::CudaRaster
and compares the rendered RGB against `raster_reference_*_300p.png` using
the FLIP perceptual metric (gate <= 0.03 mean FLIP). Parametrized for one
real scene and one synthetic scene, one frame each.

Implication: a cleanroom replacement is not validated by this file alone.
Both this file (wrapper-level contracts) and the reference-image test
(end-to-end visual regression) must pass.

Open test gaps (proposed, not yet written)
------------------------------------------
Tier A -- directly exercises the main-app path.
  A1. Stream propagation contract.
      Submit drawTriangles on a non-default torch stream, sync that stream
      only, assert the readback reflects the draw. Then enqueue work on
      stream X, capture output before+after a stream-X-only sync, assert
      the post-sync buffer differs and the pre-sync buffer (read on the
      same stream as the draw) is consistent. Catches a cleanroom impl
      that ignores the `stream` parameter and uses the default stream.
  A2. Tiled render -- 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2 tilings with rectangular
      viewports that perfectly tile the buffer (mimics ludus_cuda.cu's
      `tilesX*tilesY` nested loop). For each tiling, assert pixel-perfect
      coverage at concrete interior sample points within each tile; assert
      the last-row/last-column tile is correctly handled when the buffer
      dimension isn't a multiple of maxVp. The 2x2 case is already xfail
      (test_tiled_render_matches_single_view_interior); these positive
      contract tests for the smaller tilings should pass today.
  A3. Single-frame multi-camera pattern. Mirror the main-app loop:
      deferredClear(0); for cam in cameras: setVertexBuffer(cam_verts);
      setIndexBuffer(cam_indices); for tile: setViewport+drawTriangles.
      Assert each camera's geometry lands correctly without bleeding into
      the next, and that re-binding vertex/index buffers between draws
      within a single deferredClear period works.
  A4. End-to-end main-app smoke. One test that does exactly what
      ludusCudaRender does: setBufferSize(W,H,1); setVertexBuffer;
      setIndexBuffer; setTiebreakerColorBuffer; setDeterministicTiebreaker(
      true); deferredClear(0); tiled setViewport+drawTriangles loop on a
      non-default stream; getColorBuffer. Assert a known-good triangle id
      pattern. Acts as a regression guard for the full call sequence.
  A5. Padded-buffer correctness. setBufferSize rounds W/H up to the
      tile alignment internally (8x8); the reported `getBufferWidth/Height`
      can exceed the requested W/H. Every test today slices `[:H, :W]`
      and never asserts the padding region. Add a test that requests a
      non-tile-aligned size (e.g. 60x60 with crW/crH = 64), draws a
      triangle, and asserts the `[60:, :]` and `[:, 60:]` padding strips
      equal the deferred clear color (no garbage writes outside the
      requested viewport). Catches a cleanroom impl that scribbles
      undefined memory in the rounded-up region.

Tier B -- numerical edges real f-theta geometry will hit.
  B1. NDC-clipped triangles. Vertices outside [-1, 1]; the inside portion
      must rasterize correctly, the outside portion must produce no
      coverage. Probe with one vertex at NDC (2.5, 0.0).
  B2. Triangles partially behind the near plane (one vertex with w <= 0).
      Must produce the in-front portion only; must not wrap or crash.
  B3. Triangles with very small w (e.g. 1e-4 on one vertex). Probes
      perspective-division precision near the f-theta horizon.
  B4. CW-wound triangle with flags=0. Main app NEVER enables backface
      cull, so a CW triangle MUST rasterize. Currently nothing asserts
      this -- a cleanroom impl that quietly culls CW would silently drop
      half the geometry in production.

Tier C -- investigate before writing.
  C1. Index buffer layout. `CudaRaster.hpp` documents indices as
      `uint4 (idx0, idx1, idx2, color)` (16 B/triangle). The wrapper
      enforces `[N, 3] int32` (12 B/triangle) and passes data_ptr
      directly. Either the doc is stale or the wrapper is silently
      lying about the layout. Probe both shapes with a known triangle,
      pin whichever actually works, then either fix the wrapper or fix
      the docstring on `setIndexBuffer`.

Tier D -- improvements to the companion reference-image suite.
  Out-of-file work; track here so the cleanroom owner can decide whether
  to take them on alongside changes in this file.
  D1. Native-resolution comparison. Drop the 300p downscale before FLIP
      so subpixel rasterization changes are not smeared away by the
      bilinear downsample. Tighten the FLIP gate accordingly.
  D2. Multi-frame / multi-camera coverage. Today: one frame per scene,
      one camera. Add at least one frame with multiple cameras (mirroring
      the per-camera loop in ludusCudaRender) and one frame with a
      geometry-dense scene chunk to exercise the tiled path harder.
  D3. Depth-buffer regression. Reference-image test compares RGB only.
      Add a depth readback comparison (or a depth-derived statistic) so
      a cleanroom that breaks depth ordering without changing colors is
      caught.
  D4. Performance budget. Timestamp the render, gate the elapsed time
      against a recorded baseline (with reasonable headroom). A
      cleanroom impl that is functionally correct but 10x slower would
      pass today; the app's real-time budget would not survive.

Tier E -- cross-suite gaps neither file covers today.
  E1. Multi-arch GPU coverage. Both suites run on whichever single GPU
      is on the dev box. The HPG-2011 -> Volta+ porting work is exactly
      where bugs hide; the cleanroom replacement should be exercised on
      at least one Volta-class and one Hopper/Blackwell-class GPU before
      it is trusted in production. Today this is invisible.
  E2. Real-app workload volume. The reference-image test renders one
      frame; this file's longest test allocates 100k triangles for a
      single draw. The actual app renders thousands of frames per
      session with churning geometry. Memory-allocator behavior under
      repeated set_buffer_size calls, long-running stream stability,
      and any GPU-state leaks across many frames are unexercised.

Open scope decision
-------------------
~25 tests in this file cover features the main app does NOT use:
depth peeling (4 + 4 markers), `ranges` (3), multi-image (3), backface
culling (1), depth readback (handful), non-deterministic tiebreaker
(handful). The cleanroom replacement could either:
  (a) Preserve the full current API surface  -> keep all these tests.
  (b) Narrow the API to the main-app subset  -> delete tests for the
      removed surface and the corresponding C++ code together.
This decision affects which Tier A/B tests are worth writing and which
markers can be retired. Pending input from the project owner.

Prioritized validation roadmap (leverage-ranked)
------------------------------------------------
Before we trust a cleanroom replacement in production:
  1. A4 (end-to-end main-app smoke).        Highest leverage. Pins the
     actual call sequence ludusCudaRender uses. Catches the broadest
     class of regressions for the smallest effort.
  2. A1 (stream propagation).               Largest single correctness
     risk: a cleanroom impl that ignores the `stream` parameter would
     be silently incorrect under PyTorch's stream model.
  3. D1 (native-resolution reference).      Closes the FLIP-perceptual-
     smear gap so the visual regression test detects subpixel-correct
     rasterization changes instead of letting the downscale hide them.
  4. D4 (perf budget).                      Cheap to add, immediately
     catches the "functionally correct but unusably slow" case.

Nice-to-have, not strictly blocking the swap:
  5. E1 (multi-arch coverage).              Single biggest confidence
     gain for the Volta+ port; investment cost is CI infra, not test
     code.
  6. A5, A2, A3 (padded buffer; tiled patterns; multi-camera).
  7. Tier B (numerical edges).
  8. Tier C (index-buffer-layout probe; small but cleanup).
  9. D2, D3 (multi-frame/camera reference; depth comparison).
  10. E2 (workload-volume soak test).

How to interpret a failing test during cleanroom development
------------------------------------------------------------
* A REGRESSION MARKER fails  -> read its header; usually means the new
  impl fixed a known quirk. Action is in the comment.
* A FAILURE-MODE MARKER fails -> a CUDA-700 crash now produces a
  different error string, or no crash at all. Read the paired positive
  contract test; it will tell you which.
* An xfail xpasses (strict=True surfaces this as a failure) -> the
  cleanroom fixed the underlying bug. Remove the `xfail` decorator and
  delete the paired marker.
* A plain test fails -> investigate normally.

# CLEANROOM CONTRACT vs. CURRENT FAILURE-MODE MARKERS for depth peeling.
#
# Depth peeling currently crashes the process with CUDA error 700. We track this
# with two paired tests per scenario:
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTRACT TEST (xfail strict=True). Asserts the behavior we want
#      from a correct rasterizer. Today it fails because the impl crashes; the
#      xfail keeps the suite green. When the cleanroom replacement is correct,
#      the test xpasses and pytest reports it as an unexpected pass --- LOUD,
#      meaning "remove the xfail and the paired marker now".
#
#   2. CURRENT-IMPL FAILURE-MODE MARKER (regular test). Asserts the *specific*
#      stderr signature ("Cuda error: 700[cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);]") of
#      today's crash. If the failure mode changes (different error, different
#      stack, or no crash at all) this test fails LOUDLY so we know to look.
#
# Written 2026-05-04. If you are reading this AFTER the cleanroom replacement
# fixes peeling, DELETE both tests in each pair --- the contract is then
# expressed by a normal positive test elsewhere.
