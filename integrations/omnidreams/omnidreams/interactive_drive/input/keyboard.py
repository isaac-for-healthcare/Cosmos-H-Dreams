    """Owns live keyboard state plus the runtime UI affordances the loop reads.

    Implements :class:`~omnidreams.interactive_drive.runtime.runtime_controls.RuntimeControls`:
    ``view_mode`` is a property and reset is a rising-edge boolean consumed by
    the single loop reader. Pressed keys are still snapshotted via
    :meth:`snapshot` because iterating a shared set requires a defensive copy
    under the lock.

    Also carries a one-slot output channel: :meth:`update_telemetry` /
    :attr:`vehicle_state`. The runtime loop pushes the latest
    :class:`VehicleState` here after every chunk so the MJPEG presenter's
    ``/state`` endpoint and any other read-side observer can publish a live
    speed / steer / position snapshot to the browser without holding a
    reference to the simulation object (which is rebuilt per scene reset
    while ``KeyboardState`` is shared across the whole app session).
