# uninstalls every workspace integration (flashdreams-omnidreams,
# flashdreams-lingbot, ..., flashdreams-flashvsr) that this directory's

# The parity tests and the benchmark all run from this same venv -- the
# pyproject's ``flashdreams-flashvsr = { path = "../.." }`` editable
# source makes the candidate side (``flashvsr.transformer``,

# scripts (and our patched ``benchmark.py``) import. Idempotent: ``uv pip
# install -e`` is a no-op when the package is already wired up. The
# setup.py hunk applied above is what makes this work on setuptools
# 81+; without it the ``import pkg_resources`` line errors out at build
# time.
#
# ``--no-deps`` is load-bearing: upstream's ``setup.py`` reads
# ``requirements.txt`` straight into ``install_requires`` (see the
# applied patch -- we replaced ``pkg_resources.parse_requirements``
# with a plain line-strip but kept the file-driven dep list, matching
# upstream behavior), and that requirements.txt pins
# ``torch==2.6.0+cu124`` plus other legacy versions that conflict with
# the parity-check venv's ``torch==2.12.0`` (pulled transitively by
# ``flashdreams``). Honoring those deps would either fail to resolve
# the ``+cu124`` index (uv: "Because there is no version of
# torch==2.6.0+cu124 and diffsynth==1.1.7 depends on
# torch==2.6.0+cu124...") or downgrade torch and break every
# CUDA-typed package we just installed (transformer-engine, etc.).
# Mirrors the ``uv pip install --no-deps
# ./flashdreams`` pattern in ``.github/workflows/doc.yml``.
# Everything the parity test + benchmark actually need lives in this
# directory's ``pyproject.toml`` (or comes in transitively via
# ``flashdreams``); add missing packages there as they surface rather
# than relaxing ``--no-deps`` and re-introducing upstream's pins.

#     wrapper ``diffsynth.pipelines.flashvsr_tiny_long.model_fn_wan_video``
#     and asserts parity against the live ``flashvsr.transformer.FlashVSRTransformer``.
# Both candidates are made importable by the
# ``flashdreams-flashvsr = { path = "../.." }`` editable source declared
# in this directory's pyproject (``uv sync`` above wires it in). The
# legacy upstream side resolves via the ``uv pip install --no-deps -e
# ./FlashVSR`` step earlier in this script, which registers
# ``diffsynth`` (and the patched ``wan_video_dit.py``) in the same venv.
# Point ``FLASHVSR_WEIGHTS_ROOT`` at the parity-check's HF download so
# both tests load the same checkpoints the benchmark below will load.

# silently overwrite a broken model with a green benchmark.
